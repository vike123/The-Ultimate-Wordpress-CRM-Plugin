The Ultimate Wordpress CRM does exactly what is says, adds CRM functionality to your Wordpress based website.

== Description ==

Requires WP3+

Manage your customers/resellers/clients whatever through your Wordpress site. Will also allow customers to login and view/edit their details.

Features to include:

* Parent/Child accounts - So that accounts can belong to each other (particularly useful in reseller situations).
* Product and Services - Basic catalog of products and services to link to accounts.
* Multiple users per account - Allow multiple users to be assigned to a single account to stop login sharing. Permissions and roles to be put into place to separate functions.
* Document Drop - Ability to upload and store documents in both directions from and to the account, categorised and tagged.
* Modular development - Should be able to easily create additional extensions in the future for billing, support, anythingâ€¦.


== Installation ==

Upload the Ultimate Wordpress CRM plugin to your blog/site, Activate it.

That's it. For now anyway ;)

== Developer Notes ==

This plugin will use certain language conventions as outlined below:

Account = This is a entity such as Customer, Partner, Reseller, Client
Contact = A individual entity assigned to an account, for example John is a Contact at ACME (Account); Contacts will use the built in user system with a few tweaks.

For IF, FOREACH, WHILE etc suggest using : and endif; etc as keep the code tidier!


== Todo ==
* Group Custom Post Types and Taxonomies into a single group menu 
* Add Validation and WP Nonce to Options Page
* Draw up proper feature list
* Add DocBlock documentation

== Changelog ==
